## If Logfile is not specified BaseDir/shorter.log is used
#Logfile: "/path/to/logfile"

# LogSep is a secret log separator value to make it harder to forge log entry's

#TLSAddressPort: "127.0.0.1:10443"

## BaseDir specifies the path to the template directory for the shorter service
#BaseDir: "/path/to/template/directory"

## Email optionally specifies a contact email address.
## This is used by CAs, such as Let's Encrypt, to notify about problems with issued certificates.
## If the Client's account key is already registered, Email is not used.
#Email: "email@example.com"

## CertDir specifies the path to the directory that shorter will use to cache the LetsEnctypt certs
## If CertDir is not specified BaseDir is used.
## Note that acme/autocert will create a acme directory in the specified path and save all certs in this directory.
